    for all games in day:
      open box score link
      find name of team1
        open team1 file for this season
        collect stats
        append stats to file data
        save file
      find name of team2
        repeat for team2

    go to previous day

file layout:
  columns: date | identifier for team 2 | stats for team 1 | stats for team 2


TODO:
  add the identifier to the data

  when reading in the date:
    define the game number to predict
    go to that index
    identify other team
    splice off data from the previous game number
    do the same for team2
      NOTE: will need to find exact number/index -- may be different, so zero pad
    concatenate the two files together

  pad matrix with zeros
  flip the data so that the first vector input is the first game of the season
